- Decision Trees outperformed Logistic Regression in predicting severe accidents.
- Most fatal accidents occurred on rural roads under poor lighting and wet conditions.
- Sentiment analysis of tweets revealed a dominant negative sentiment around traffic incidents.

---

## 📈 Recommendations

- Improve lighting infrastructure on rural roads.
- Use predictive insights to inform traffic police deployment.
- Run targeted awareness campaigns via Twitter during accident-prone hours.
