# 🚗 Surrey Road Accident Analysis (2021)

This repository presents a comprehensive data mining and text analytics project conducted as part of the MSc Business Analytics module (MANM528 – Data Mining and Text Analytics) at the University of Surrey.

---

## 📊 Project Overview

The project analyses real-world road traffic accident data from Surrey (UK) for 2021 using structured datasets and SAS Viya tools. The goals are:

- Clean and explore the dataset (Task 1)
- Predict accident severity using machine learning (Task 2)
- Perform text analysis on related tweets (Task 3)
- Provide a managerial summary with recommendations (Task 4)

## 🔍 Key Findings

- Decision Trees performed better than Logistic Regression in classifying severe accidents.
- Fatal accidents were more likely on unlit rural roads under wet conditions.
- Twitter sentiment was largely negative, focused on delays and incident awareness.

---

## 📈 Recommendations

- Install better lighting on rural roads with high accident rates.
- Use predictive models to inform police patrolling strategies.
- Publish timely accident alerts via Twitter and other public channels.
